# Project Manager Streamlit App

## Before Using

**IMPORTANT**: Update the AdaLab URL to your corresponding installation in the script string defined in the `embed_script` function in `streamlit_app/components.py`.

The chatbot functionality of this app depends on a Workspace in an Anything LLM instance. For the purpose of this demo, a test Workspace was created using the information in this README. If you are using this project as a template for a different project, remember to create a workspace in the Anything LLM app deployed in your AdaLab and feed it with the documents relevant for your project. After that, go to the `Embedded Chat` tab in Configuration and click on the `Create embed` blue button to create a client for your Workspace. Once you have done this, copy the values for `data-embed-id`, `data-base-api-url`, and `src` into the corresponding entries in the fucntion `embed_script` in the `streamlit_app/components.py` file.

This repository contains a Streamlit app designed to help manage projects efficiently. The app is visually attractive and feature-rich, with various sections to provide a comprehensive project management experience.

## Utilities 

The **`utils.py`** file contains helper functions such as **`load_data`** for loading data from a CSV file.

### Example Usage
To use the **`load_data`** function:
```python
from streamlit_app.utils import load_data

data = load_data('path_to_your_file.csv')
st.write(data)
```

## Testing
Tests are located in the **`tests`** directory. To run the tests, use:
```sh
poetry run pytest
```

### Writing Tests
Here's an example of how to write a simple test in **`tests/test_utils.py`**:
```python
from streamlit_app.utils import load_data

def test_load_data():
    # Test load_data function
    data = load_data('tests/sample_data.csv')
    assert not data.empty
```
